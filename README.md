1. THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN.

    _ ON DIET.

1. THE MEDICINES.

    _ ASTHMATIC TINCTURE.

    _ ASTRINGENT ELECTARY.

    _ ITS DOSE.

    _ BALSAMIC ELECTARY

    _ BARK.

    _ BARK DECOCTION.

    _ BARK WINE.

    _ BARLEY WATER.

    _ COLIC MIXTUREThis is a medicine I can ſtrongly recommend indeed, and what no family ought to be without.—Complaints of this kind we are every day ſubject to, and for want of a proper relief at hand, ſtrong waters and cordial drams are too often uſed. I have received ſeveral letters from thoſe I never ſaw, in praiſe of the colic mixture: the letter I have now before me, from the late Richard Weddel, Eſq; concludes with theſe words: "It is an excellent remedy, and has done me great ſervice.".

    _ DIACHYLON PLASTER.

    _ DIACHYLON WITH GUMS.

    _ DIURETIC MIXTURE.

    _ ELIXIR OF VITRIOL.

    _ ITS DOSE.

    _ FEVER POWDERThe fever powder is an antimonial preparation, ſimilar in its nature to that which is called JAMES'S Powder, but it is prepared with ſuch care as to render it much more gentle in its operation: I frequently adminiſter it to infants without its producing any material evacuation. Should the ſtomach, however, be foul, it will cauſe ſickneſs; in that caſe give a little warm water, or chamomile tea, to cleanſe the ſtomach, and you will find the patient greatly relieved by this operation; and if the ſecond doſe ſhould either vomit or purge too much, you may decreaſe the quantity, or not adminiſter it ſo frequently..

    _ ITS DOSE.

    _ FIT DROPS FOR CHILDREN.

    _ FRYAR'S BALSAM

    _ GASCOIGN'S POWDER.

    _ GARGLE FOR SORE THROATS.

    _ GLAUBER'S SALTS.

    _ HARTSHORN DROPS

    _ HARTSHORN AND GUM.

    _ HEART-BURN LOZENGES.

    _ HIERA PICRA

    _ HYSTERIC MIXTURE.

    _ JAUNDICE ELECTARY.

    _ IPECACUANHA

    _ FOR THE ITCH.

    _ LAUDANUM.

    _ MAGNESIA ALBAThis medicine ſeems well calculated for diſorders in the ſtomach, and, from my own experience, I can atteſt it is a valuable one, if genuine; and think it my duty to caution the public where they buy it, for there are many notorious abuſes practiſed, to enable the venders to ſell this, and many other compoſitions, cheap: —very often chalk is mixed with the magneſia; ſome prepare it from alum, which affords a large quantity of white earth, but of a very different nature; and too frequently lime is waſhed until it becomes inſipid, and ſold for magneſia alba.

    _ MANNA

    _ MARSHMALLOW DRINK.

    _ NERVOUS TINCTURE.

    _ OIL OF ROSES.

    _ OILY EMULSION.

    _ OPENING ELECTARY.

    _ OPODELDOC

    _ PALSY DROPS.

    _ PARALYTIC OR PALSY-LINIMENT.

    _ PARLIAMENT LOZENGES.

    _ PECTORAL DRINK.

    _ PILE ELECTARY.

    _ PILE LINIMENT.

    _ POWDER FOR SWEATS.

    _ ITS DOSE.

    _ PURGING APOZEM.

    _ QUICK PURGING POWDER.

    _ ITS DOSE.

    _ RHEUMATIC POWDER.

    _ RHUBARB POWDER.

    _ ITS DOSE.

    _ RUM CAUDLE.

    _ SALOP

    _ SALT OF WORMWOOD DRAUGHT.

    _ SAL VOLATILE.

    _ This preparation is the acid of the ſea ſalt, reduced into a convenient form to be carried into remote parts; the purgative quality of the ſea water is, in a great meaſure, taken away, ſo that it remains longer in the body, and, conſequently, takes a greater effect upon the blood;—and many whoſe ſtomachs will not bear ſea water, will find this an agreeable palatable liquor,—if they do not make it too acid;—and for ſcorbutical eruptions a valuable preſent: but gouty patients muſt not be too free with it.SCORBUTIC ELIXIR.

    _ SENA TEA.

    _ SHAM ASSES MILK.

    _ SNUFF FOR THE HEAD-ACH.

    _ SPERMA CETI BOLUS.

    _ SPERMA CETI EMULSION.

    _ SPERMA CETI AND SUGAR-CANDY.

    _ SPIRIT OF LAVENDER

    _ STEEL ELECTARY.

    _ I cannot paſs by this tincture without giving that praiſe which is juſtly due to it.—In weak ſtomachs, whether from intemperance or conſtitutional, it is equally efficacious; when there is alſo an acidity in the ſtomach, or the patient be of a coſtive habit of body, a doſe of the magneſia ſhould be taken likewiſe, once or twice a day.—I ſpeak with the certainty of ſucceſs, when I declare, that this regimen, purſued for a month or two, will remove complaints in the ſtomach that have been of long ſtanding, and thought incurable. And in hectic and intermittent fevers, attended with loſs of appetite, after proper evacuations have been uſed, it is a ſovereign remedy, when joined with the decoction of bark.STOMACH TINCTURE.
